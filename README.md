# FirstMLModel

A simple example to train a Machine Learning model. It's just a quick glimpse of training models.

I hope it could be your first step in Machine Learning.

### Environment Preparation
[Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org) are required.

You can download an [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads/) for a easy setup.

### Description
[CoreMLModelDemo.py](https://github.com/chenyi1989/FirstMLModel/blob/master/CoreMLModelDemo.py) shows a minimum code to train a model which can predict a person's weight by his gender and height.
